# How to Activate PhotoModeler Scanner and Create 3D Models from Photos
  
PhotoModeler Scanner is a software that allows you to create accurate, high-quality 3D models and measurements from photographs. The process is called photo-based 3D scanning. PhotoModeler Scanner is a 3D scanner that provides results similar to a 3D laser scanner. This 3D scanning process produces a dense point cloud (Dense Surface Modeling, DSM) from photographs of textured surfaces of virtually any size[^3^].

In this article, we will show you how to activate PhotoModeler Scanner and use it to create 3D models from photos. You will need a digital camera, a computer, and a PhotomodelerScannerActivationKey.
  
## Step 1: Install PhotoModeler Scanner
  
To install PhotoModeler Scanner, you need to download the software from the official website[^3^] or from a trusted source. You can choose between a 64-bit or a 32-bit version depending on your system. The installation file is about 237 MB in size. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation.
  
## Step 2: Activate PhotoModeler Scanner
  
To activate PhotoModeler Scanner, you need a PhotomodelerScannerActivationKey. This is a code that looks like pNNN-NNNNN-NNNN-LLLL-LLLL-LLLL-LLLL. You can get this code from your order email or CD package sticker if you purchased the software. If you want to try the software for free, you can request a trial activation code from the official website[^3^].
  
Once you have your PhotomodelerScannerActivationKey, you need to enter it on the PhotoModeler Activation dialog that appears when you run the software for the first time. You can also access this dialog from the Help menu. Click on the Activate button and enter your PhotomodelerScannerActivationKey. The code will be verified on the license server and if successful, your software will be activated.
  
## Step 3: Create 3D Models from Photos
  
To create 3D models from photos, you need to follow these steps:
  
- Take photos of the object or scene you want to model from different angles and distances. Make sure the photos are clear, well-lit, and have enough overlap and texture.
- Import the photos into PhotoModeler Scanner using the File menu or drag and drop them into the project window.
- Mark points of interest on the photos using the tools on the toolbar or the right-click menu. You can mark manual points, coded targets, scale bars, reference lines, etc.
- Run the orientation process to calculate the camera positions and orientations for each photo. You can use the Auto-Orientation wizard or the manual orientation tools.
- Run the DSM process to generate a dense point cloud from the photos. You can adjust the settings such as resolution, quality, smoothing, etc.
- Export the point cloud as a mesh or a surface using the Export menu or the right-click menu. You can choose between different formats such as OBJ, STL, PLY, etc.

You can also edit, measure, texture, and render your 3D models using PhotoModeler Scanner's features. For more details and tutorials, you can visit the official website[^3^] or watch this video[^1^].
  
## Conclusion
  
PhotoModeler Scanner is a powerful software that lets you create 3D models and measurements from photographs. It is easy to use and provides accurate results. To use it, you need a digital camera, a computer, and a PhotomodelerScannerActivationKey. You can get this key from your order email or CD package sticker if you purchased the software or request a trial activation code from the official website. Once you activate PhotoModeler Scanner, you can import your photos, mark points of interest, run orientation and DSM processes, and export your 3D models as meshes or surfaces.
