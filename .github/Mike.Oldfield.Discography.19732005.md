Soundtracks

Oldfield has composed and performed music for several films and documentaries, often using themes and motifs from his previous albums. His first soundtrack was for *The Exorcist* (1973), which used the opening part of *Tubular Bells* as its main theme. Although Oldfield did not receive any credit or royalties for this, the film helped to popularize his music and boost his album sales.

In 1979, Oldfield was commissioned by NASA to create music for *The Space Movie*, a documentary celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Oldfield used excerpts from his albums *Tubular Bells*, *Hergest Ridge*, *Ommadawn* and *Incantations*, as well as some new material, to accompany the footage of the space missions. The soundtrack was not released as an album until 2015, when a DVD and CD were issued.

One of Oldfield's most acclaimed soundtracks was for *The Killing Fields* (1984), a film about the Cambodian genocide. Oldfield composed an original score that blended orchestral, electronic and ethnic elements, creating a haunting and emotional atmosphere. The soundtrack album also included a vocal version of his hit single *Moonlight Shadow*, sung by Edda Dell'Orso.

Other films and documentaries that Oldfield has contributed music to include *The X-Files* (1998), *Tubular Bells II Live* (1992), *Tubular Bells III Live* (1998), *The Art in Heaven Concert* (2000), *The Millennium Bell Live in Berlin* (2001) and *MÃºsica es... Mike Oldfield* (2005).
